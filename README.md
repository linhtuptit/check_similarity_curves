# **Frechet distance**
According to [1], in mathematics, the Fr√©chet distance is a measure of similarity between curves that takes into account the location and ordering of the points along the curves.

# **Procrustes Analysis**
In statistics, Procrustes analysis is a form of statistical shape analysis used to analyse the distribution of a set of shapes [2]. According to this, to compare two curves, the curves must be first optimally "super-imposed". It means that the curve is optimally translated, rotated and uniformly scaled.

# **Results**
Some of results representing the level of similarity of two curves in several scenarios are depicted below.
